# Survival Modeling in Oncology Using R
A comprehensive survival analysis and economic evaluation for a hypothetical cancer treatment, Ultradrug, using R. 
The analysis follows the structure of a health technology assessment, incorporating survival modeling, treatment switching adjustments, and cost-effectiveness modeling. # Non-parametric methods such as Kaplan–Meier curves and RMST were used to compare treatment arms. 
Proportional hazard assumptions were assessed using diagnostic plots including log–log plots, Schoenfeld residuals, and smoothed hazard functions. Parametric models—both combined and independently fitted—were evaluated using the flexsurv package, with log-normal selected as the base-case model due to its flexible hazard representation and strong visual fit. Additional packages such as survival, survminer, survRM2, bshazard, ggplot2, and muhaz supported data processing, visualization, and model diagnostics. 
Treatment switching was adjusted using a Two-Stage Estimation approach based on an AFT model, and a partitioned survival model was built to estimate QALYs and ICERs.
